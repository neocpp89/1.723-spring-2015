I am sorry about the small size of the images, I got stuck on one part of solving the equation and I did not have enough time to prettify the report. The higher quality, full size images are in the zip archive with the code.

\section{Problem 1}
For the boundary conditions, we will start with the equation
\begin{align}
 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
\end{align}
and derive the finite volume method from there.
Taking an integral and using the divergence theorem, we can write
\begin{align}
\int_\Omega \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}\ \mathrm{dV} &= 0 \\
\int_{\Gamma_{L}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} +
\int_{\Gamma_{D}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} +
\int_{\Gamma_{R}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} +
\int_{\Gamma_{U}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} &= 0.
\end{align}
For each of the boundaries, we simply set the corresponding integrated flux to zero.
We will derive the equation for the bottom boundary; the others are similar.

Since the flux through the bottom boundary is zero, the equation above is reduced to
\begin{align}
\int_{\Gamma_{L}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} +
\int_{\Gamma_{R}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} +
\int_{\Gamma_{U}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} &= 0.
\end{align}

The nondimensionalized darcy velocity is given by
\begin{align}
\mathbf{u} = - (\nabla p - c \nabla z).
\end{align}

Using the two point flux approximation, we can write the boundary integrals as
\begin{align}
\int_{\Gamma_{L}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} &= - \frac{\delta z}{\delta x} (p_{i,j-1} - p_{i,j}) \\
\int_{\Gamma_{R}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} &= \frac{\delta z}{\delta x} (p_{i,j} - p_{i,j+1}) \\
\int_{\Gamma_{U}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} &= - \frac{\delta x}{\delta z} \left( (p_{i-1,j} - p_{i,j}) - \delta z c_{i-1/2,j} \right).
\end{align}

For the interior problems, we simply add the integral for the bottom boundary given by
\begin{align}
\int_{\Gamma_{D}} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}\ \mathrm{dS} &= \frac{\delta x}{\delta z} \left( (p_{i,j} - p_{i+1,j}) - \delta z c_{i+1/2,j} \right).
\end{align}

For the transport equations, we use the upwinding scheme for the advective term as done before in homework.
Similarly, the diffusive term is given by a two point flux approximation as before (though Rayleigh number replaces Peclet number).
At the boundaries, we are given that $\frac{\partial c}{\partial n} = 0$ except the top, which is given a constant value of $c = 1$ (plus a perturbation).
Since the velocities at the boundaries are constrained to be zero, the only nonzero term is the diffusive part in the top boundary, and is given by
\begin{align}
F_{1/2, j} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Ra}} \frac{\delta x} {\delta z} \left( 2 \bar{c}_{j} - 2 c_{1, j} \right).
\end{align}

The code which implements these equations is attached, but is reproduced in \cref{code:integrate} for convenience.

\section{Problem 2}
The concentration, pressure, and velocity fields are shown in figures \ref{fig:Ra1}, \ref{fig:Ra2}, and \ref{fig:Ra4} for various Rayleigh numbers. A grid size of 128x128 was used.
Although the dynamics are qualitatively as expected (diffusive phase, then advective phase where fingers form and combine, then a saturated phase), I am a bit surprised by the timescale (it takes much longer than I expected in nondimensional time).
There may be an error in the scaling of the integrated fluxes, but I was not able to determine the problem.

\subsection{Part 1}
We plot the results of the density-driven flow for various Rayleigh number.
One of the first things we notice is that the number and variety of fingers seems to be affected by Rayleigh number.
For instance, when Ra = $1000$, the fingers at t=4 seem to be relatively straight and uniformly distributed.
At Ra = 2000, they seem to curve more and are less uniform, and there appear to be a few more, and by Ra = 4000 the fingers are very different from each other.
The fingers remain distinct for longer at higher Rayleigh number as well.
This makes sense, since when Rayleigh number is high it means diffusion is less important than advection, so instabilities can hold their shapes for longer.

\subsection{Part 2}
We clearly see that in the beginning, a diffusive boundary layer forms.
Surprisingly, it seems some sort of boundary layer persists throughout the simulation.
However, we also see advection become dominant at later times, resulting in 'steps' where concentration plateaus and quickly decreases.
I think this is characteristic of moving fronts.
After the fingers hit the bottom of the boundary, aside from the boundary layer the horizontally averaged concentration becomes much more homogeneous.
If we look at the simulation. there appears to be more mixing at this stage (whole system vortices form).

\subsection{Part 3}
The total concentrations as a function of time are plotted next.
While it is a bit difficult to distinguish the regimes with the higher Rayleigh number, there appears to be a difference between the advective and diffusive phases of the flow.
It is more difficult to determine when the saturated phase occurs, although it looks like the rate of increase in total concentration returns to a lower slope after the mixing phase.
Looking at just the total concentration plots, it seems that the Rayleigh number affects the time before the advective phase (with fingers forming and merging) begins.
This may just be an issue in my code, as the nondimensionalized times seem too large.

I would guess it is possible to predict the transition times depending on the density contrast, since one could do an analysis of bouyant forces and see when it becomes unstable.
